Description: Linreg class calculates the computations required for multiple regression model
    using the ordinary least square method. It also provides methods like print, plot,
    resid, coef and summary. The Ridgereg class calculates computations required for
    multiple regression using the OLS method, and additionally, it applies a penalty
    term, lambda, that shrinks the coefficients as it is increased and also reduces the
    flexibility of the slope. The ridgereg vignette and the flight delay vignettes employ
    machine learning models for predicting Median Value of BostonHousing dataset and Delay
    of flights from nycflights dataset respectively. Additionally, there is also a function
    that visualizes mean delay of flights for airports in the USA.
